<h1><U>Preface</U></h1>

<p>The goal of this application and tutorial is to 
help Java game programmers construct textures based upon 
gradient noise. After reading through this tutorial
you will have the knowledge of the basic techniques and
many of the classic 2D textures: from clouds to fireballs
to planet surfaces. You will also have a handy tool for 
exploring and developing your own textures.</p>

<p>This program makes use of the public domain implementation
of Ken Perlin's Simplex Noise algorithm written by Stefan
Gustavson. Those wishing to learn more about the mathematics
of gradient noise in general and of the Simplex Noise function
should in particular should read Gustavson's excellent 
article: "Simplex noise demystified" from 2005-03-22.</p>
